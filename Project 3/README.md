eFun Frogger Game
=================

Welcome to the eFun Frogger Game. Make sure you read the instructions and goals before you proceed with the game.

Goal
====
The goal is to get as many points as possible and at the same time, save the life of the avatar from the enemy. 

Details
=======
If the avatar collides with the enemy, then the avatar will lose a life and the avatar will be repositioned to the start point (if the avatar has enough lives)

If the avatar collides with the enemy, and that’s the last life, then the game will be over.

If the avatar successfully avoids the enemy and hits the collectible, then the avatar will gain points or lives or both as below:

- Gems
1. Green will get 5 points
2. Blue will get 10 points
3. Orange will get 15 points

- Heart
A heart will increase the life count of the avatar by 1

- Star
A star will increase the life count of the avatar by 1 and also get 20 points

Difficulty Levels
=================
Easy: As the name suggests, this is the easiest. The bugs move relatively slower than other modes, and there’s more time. But the number of lives is less.

Medium: The bugs move a bit faster now and there’s more time than hard but less than easy. The number of lives is in the middle between easy and hard.

Hard: Be forewarned! The bugs will race. There’s more lives but less time.
